# AnonShowTech
A simple Python script to anonymise show-tech output file from Cisco switches

This is a very basic script to anonymise a show-tech file generated by a Cisco switch.
The script will remove all text from the key fields in the 'fields' dictionary and replaces it with the value belonging to the key.

It takes a filename as input on the cli and the output is the filename with -anon added to it.
The original file will be left unaltered.
